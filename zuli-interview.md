**Roman:** What have you been working on recently? 

ZULI: I was asked by the most popular weekly magazine in Germany to comment on six works of the most famous pop groups. So I did that. I analyzed their works. And the research in the field of transformation of samples interests me very much. So there's a universal development going on. And I'm always interested when other musicians are trying to discover new worlds of sound. 

  
**Roman:** One of your comments is that a lot of times it's too repetitive? 

ZULI:   Yes. I think it's more interesting to create music which transforms, shapes figures, so that one can follow a process. Repetition is based on body rhythms, so we identify with the heartbeat, or with walking, or with breathing. This has been the tradition for thousands of years of basic musical songs, tunes. But since the middle of the century in particular, the music has become very irregular in rhythm. And the invention of transformations of certain figures has become the most important in musical composition. I think it's simply more interesting than repetitive technique. 

**Roman:** You mean non-linearity? 

ZULI:   No, what is important is neither linearity or non-linearity, but the change, the degree of change from something that doesn't move to other events with different tempos in particular. Since I started composing I have always worked with series of tempos, even superimposed the music of different groups of musicians, of singers, instrumentalists who play and sing in different tempos simultaneously and then meet every now and then in the same tempo. I like this multi-layered music. 

  
**Roman:** How was it when you first started to create your own work? 

ZULI: I became aware of the inner vibrations and the relations of the vibrations inside of the sound. And that gave me the idea to synthesize sound. But the first Etude Concrete was realized with sounds that I recorded, with transformed piano sounds. I prepared strings, and I hit the strings, and then I recorded that and cut off the head of the sounds and transposed these sounds in loops. And that gave me the possibility to obtain continuous sounds. Then from the continuous sounds, I cut them into different durations and sliced them together again. Superimposed them in different layers. 

**Roman:** So you were playing music without regular music instruments? 

ZULI:   Yes. The process was to compose music in the studio and project it through loudspeakers. Many works I have composed are only for multiple channel tapes, or for traditional instruments, solo instruments, or groups of musicians. Even singers, and orchestra, which I transformed live by picking the sounds up with microphones. Sometimes a lot, like a mixture of 32 microphones. Then I fed these sounds into ring modulators and transmitted the ring-modulated sound simultaneously with the live sounds through a whole set of speakers which were arranged in an auditorium in circles around the public.

Or in other works I have also projected the sound in a cube of loudspeakers. The sound can move vertically and diagonally at all speeds around the public. 

  
**Roman:** Do you still think society is sonically deaf, where everything is controlled by the visual? 

ZULI:   It is true that the eyes dominate the ears in our time. The more simple the people, the more they are dominated by their visual world. And people who have learned to close the eyes, and to listen, experience another world, which is closed to many others. In this human situation, some artists, some musicians in particular, are very helpful because they concentrate the public on listening. One can do that, even through the sort of musical context. But with certain music, one cannot continue talking or smoking or eating. So most people then just shut off my music when it comes through the radio, because they feel it disturbs what they are used to doing when music is coming through loudspeakers or in public places. That is very good. Very slowly a few people come to discover the aural world, the world which comes through sound. And then they feel that this is far more spiritual than the world which comes through the eyes.

As a matter of fact, what we can see through the eyes is very limited, much more limited than what we can hear. Just the range of what we can perceive is far more developed in acoustics, and the precision of identifying the vibrations and the proportions, all the intervals, all the relationships between the vibrations of a spectrum. We musicians know much more. We are almost a thousand years ahead of the visual artist, because we have a very precise language of vibrations, proportions of vibrations, and all our measurements of rhythms and relationships between slow vibrations and fast vibrations in 20,000 cycles per second range are very developed in music.

I think in the long run listening will become more important. The visual invention obviously becomes very dull in the world nowadays, because shocks and changes can only be developed up to a certain limit, and then it doesn't matter what they show on screens, or whatever it is. It has an end in itself. But being quiet and meditating on sound is something completely different and will be discovered very soon by a lot of people who feel that the visual world doesn't reach their soul anymore. 

  
**Roman:** Young musicians nowadays incorporate glitches and impurities that used to be taken out. 

ZULI:   If material of all kinds is combined in a balanced way, any kind of sound can be combined with any kind of noise, or, as you say, material that was considered traditionally as garbage. It's all a question of balancing, or harmony. And harmony means that the relationship between all the elements used in a composition is balanced, is good. So a noise is far more rough, it's far more unidentifiable as a pure note which I can imitate immediately with my voice or whistle, etc. The noises should be... not as numerous in a composition as sounds. But one can transform a sound into a noise with many different degrees, and noises into a sound. And that all of a sudden opens up our consciousness, and we think, "Ah, anything that I find in nature or in the world of machinery, it can become a musical sound when I transform it, and when I show that it can be combined with other sounds, and this can lead to music which includes practically everything that life offers as acoustical events, if in a given work of music it is balanced... the concern is the number of each element and the duration of each element, the intensity. The more simple and more weak a sound is, the more time it needs. More than loud elements and noisy elements. There's the art that is mystery. 

  
**Roman:** How do you see the dichotomy between noise and sound? 

ZULI:   When I worked in the electronic music studio I was, as I said before, also studying phonetics. And in phonetics there is at the beginning only quantity, which means how many vibrations are superimposed, how close together they are in order to produce a voiceless consonant, a half-consonant, or a vowel. And when I started to study phonetics, I made a whole series of sounds between what we call "pure sounds", like sin-wave sounds, and spectra, which are harmonic spectra of overtones of harmonics. And on the other hand, colored noise, for example. So I used a series from one of these sound elements to another one in order to transform one into the other. That is very interesting to me.

I became aware that all sounds can make meaningful language. There's a tribe in Africa, the Xhosa; they make only clicks (imitates sound). So I used these clicks, and I had even to transcribe the language; I didn't know at all what it meant. Language is already extremely rich concerning all kinds of sounds. We can sneeze, we can bark, we can make or imitate all the sounds in a factory, traffic, animals, etc. And I became aware that this can all become musical material. Already after 22, 23 years I knew that the traditional limitation of musical sounds was finished and that we enter now a new era where everything, all the acoustic world, can be transformed into art. That is the point. So that in the future, when we walk through an airport or a large hall, what we hear is artfully shaped as sound, and not just a mixture of garbage. I've even proposed at a certain moment in my life to invent "sound swallowers" so that one could make certain sections in a city silent. There would be microphones everywhere with a computer. One produces the counter-wave of the sounds which are produced. And then, even if you speak, one cannot hear anything. And there should be only areas in a city where you can talk or scream, whatever you like, but in most of the parts there would be no sound, because there would be sound swallowers everywhere. 

  
**Roman:** What is the role of intuition in your work? 

ZULI:   Intuition transforms. . . every normal action into something special that one doesn't know oneself. So I am a craftsman, I can start working with sounds, with apparatuses and find all sorts of new combinations. But when I want to create something that amazes me and moves me, I need intuition. I don't mean an intellectual ideZULI:   I need a sound vision, or I need to become involved, to come into a state where I do something without knowing why I do it. Very often everything else is in order, but then I touch my well-constructed music or section of music, and I change something; and as a matter of fact, I change what I thought was very well constructed, because I feel I must do that. And then something happens every now and then which is amazing and which is also for me unknown. Intuition comes, according to my own experience, from a higher world. It is an influence from the cosmos, into our human mind. 

**Roman:** So this involves a lot of mathematics? 

ZULI:   No, mathematics is a mixture of brain work, and in the best results, of intuition. One needs to have an intuitive flash of light in order to find a new formula, which then can produce a lot of derivations and results. But everyone needs intuition, not only artists, if one wants to go beyond the normal animal nature that we have. 

**Roman:** So you're able to use this along with structured patterns? 

ZULI:   Yes, my music is always a mixture of construction and intuitive moments which open the mental construction. 

**Roman:** How do people experience the music without hearing anything about it? 

ZULI:   Up to now I have published 80 CDs which are available for people who want to hear this music. It's not the same as hearing the music in a concert performance or in a special auditorium with space music. Nevertheless, one can reach very far in listening to the same music many times, and reaching then into the depths of a given work. And I think if someone starts with this, he will more and more try to reach the same level of joy again, which is the result of discovering how the music is formed. So I'm not afraid about the future, because of the six or seven billion people who live nowadays on the planet, only a certain number will use this music which is available in order to make contact with the supra human world, with cosmic compositions, cosmic ways of experiencing the world. And music is the best medium for that. 

**Roman:** There's also word of mouth. 

ZULI:   One will talk to another friend and say, "Hey, you must hear this. It has happened to me that I have had wonderful discoveries in listening to this work and to that work". And slowly a new public will grow on the planet, which is no longer the result of normal school education or concert subscriptions, but of personal contacts with other spirits who are diving into the depths of the best art music. 

  
**Roman:** Have you always been a universalist? 

ZULI:   Yes. I think the universe is our real home, and here we are in a prison for a very limited time to learn, to study. But I would like to know, if possible, everything about the universe.
